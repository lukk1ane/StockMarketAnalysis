## Detailed Statistical Analysis Results

### Basic Statistics
```
Closing Volume Statistics:
- Count: 2500 trading days
- Mean: 49.98 
- Standard Deviation: 29.21
- Min: 0.055
- 25th percentile: 24.35
- Median: 49.94
- 75th percentile: 75.82
- Max: 99.97

Volume Statistics:
- Mean: 492,856.66
- Standard Deviation: 290,101.90
- Min: 188.26
- Max: 999,354.30
```

### Distribution Analysis
**Normality Test Results for Daily Returns:**
- Statistic: 5980.39
- P-value: 0.0000
- **Interpretation:** The extremely low p-value (< 0.05) strongly indicates that daily returns do not follow a normal distribution. This is typical for financial time series and suggests the presence of fat tails and potential extreme events.

### Risk Metrics
**Value at Risk (VaR):**
- 95% VaR: -0.9035
- **Interpretation:** With 95% confidence, we can expect the daily loss not to exceed 0.9035% of the portfolio value. This metric is crucial for risk management and position sizing.

**Annualized Volatility:**
- Value: 380.2750%
- **Interpretation:** This indicates extremely high price variability over the year. The high volatility suggests significant price swings and potential trading opportunities, but also increased risk.

### Moving Average Crossover Analysis
**Trend Signals:**
- Golden Crosses: 111 occurrences
- Death Crosses: 112 occurrences
- **Interpretation:** The almost equal number of bullish (Golden Cross) and bearish (Death Cross) signals suggests a cyclical or range-bound market over the analyzed period.

### Volume Analysis
**Trading Activity Metrics:**
- Average Daily Volume: 492,857 shares
- Volume Coefficient of Variation: 0.5886
- **Interpretation:** 
  - The coefficient of variation (0.5886) indicates moderate volume volatility
  - This suggests relatively consistent trading activity with some notable spikes

## Statistical Insights and Trading Implications

### 1. Distribution Characteristics
- The non-normal distribution of returns (p-value â‰ˆ 0) suggests:
  - Traditional risk models assuming normality may underestimate risk
  - Need for more sophisticated risk management approaches
  - Potential for "black swan" events

### 2. Risk Assessment
- High annualized volatility (380.27%) indicates:
  - Significant price swings
  - Need for strict position sizing
  - Opportunities for volatility-based trading strategies

### 3. Market Trend Analysis
- The balanced number of Golden/Death crosses suggests:
  - No dominant long-term trend
  - Potential for range-bound trading strategies
  - Need for additional confirmation signals

### 4. Volume Profile
- Moderate volume coefficient of variation (0.5886) indicates:
  - Relatively stable trading activity
  - Reliable liquidity for position entry/exit
  - Potential for volume-based trading signals

## Trading Strategy Implications

### 1. Risk Management
- Implement strict position sizing based on 0.9035% VaR
- Consider volatility-based position adjustments
- Use stop-losses aligned with statistical volatility measures

### 2. Trading Approaches
- Focus on mean-reversion strategies due to range-bound behavior
- Utilize volume confirmation for entry/exit points
- Consider volatility-based trading opportunities

### 3. System Development
- Incorporate non-normal distribution in risk models
- Design strategies around the identified cyclic nature
- Use volume analysis for trade confirmation
